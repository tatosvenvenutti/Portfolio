                        The purpose of this project was to demonstrate the implementation and visualization of Conway's Game of Life. 
                        This marked my first experience with a form of artificial intelligence, even if it's a simple one. 
                        Additionally, I used this project as an opportunity to learn and practice proper UI design, which required me to acquire a substantial amount of new knowledge and skills.

                        This project was by far the most challenging one since I had never delved into graphics before. 
                        But I decided to use DirectX11 because it seemed fairly straightforward. 
                        I began by creating a basic map in Blender, which I then rendered out to use in the project. 
                        Then I stored the data using an Object-Oriented design.
                        Finally, I rendered out the matrices and added other features such as music and different levels.
