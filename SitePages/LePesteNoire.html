                    <h2>Knight AI</h2>
                    <p>
                        While our game originally only had zombies, I took the leap and told my team I would take a swing at AI.
                        I never looked back; creating these knights was something I was so proud of, from designing their attacks to developing behavior trees and debugging through the knights.
                        They brought me joy like no other. With these knights, I wanted them to have combos, charge attacks, and blocking followed by a counter-attack.
                        I am so glad I was able to make it all happen with what I had the knowledge of.

                    <h2>Boss AI</h2>
                    <p>
                        While not my most ambitious project, this was the first enemy I developed, and a boss no less.
                        I wanted him to be more defensive and almost territorial, where he shoots projectiles to make you push him and then use large sweeping attacks to make you keep your distance.
                        This created an almost back-and-forth rhythm of retreating and advancing.

                    <p>
                        To add more life into the open world, nature must be present.
                        So, as a last-minute decision, I programmed basic animal AI for deer (shown in the GIF), pigs, wolves, and foxes.
                        These were something I never intended on making, but nevertheless, it was something I wanted to give a shot.

                            It's a powerful move where he strikes the ground with a large hammer.
